WxConnector
===========

WxConnector is intended as a project to provide a client/server
solution for collecting data from a weather station. The motivation
was the arrival of a Vantage Vue weather station which has a nice
console for everyday use but the solutions for collecting data
didn't fit in with my requirments.

My efforts to hack in data collection working as I wanted didn't work
and so I decided to write this small project. 

It's still in development and I have no idea where it'll end up,
but the code is here and available for anyone else mad^H^H^Hbrave
enough to try it :-)
